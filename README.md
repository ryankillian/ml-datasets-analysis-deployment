## Traditional Machine Learning Models

For each dataset, we have performed exploratory data analysis and implemented various traditional machine learning models, such as logistic regression and random forest.

## Neural Networks with PyTorch

We have also implemented neural networks using PyTorch for the datasets, including multi-layer perceptrons (MLP) for MNIST.

## Docker Deployment

This repository includes Dockerfiles and Python scripts for deploying the PyTorch models as RESTful web services using Docker containers. This allows for easy inference with the trained models.
